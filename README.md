# Data Visualization: Creating Graphs with Python Libraries

This repository contains a project that demonstrates data visualization using various Python libraries. The project uses data from a .csv file detailing immigration from all countries to Canada from 1980 to 2013. The data is filtered and visualized through different types of graphs, including interactive graphs, and demonstrates methods for exporting these visualizations.

## Project Overview
The project aims to explore and visualize immigration data using the Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly libraries, creating various visual representations and learning best practices for data visualization.

## Course Details
This project was completed as part of a course on Alura. For more information about the course, visit [Alura](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/data-visualization-graficos-bibliotecas-python).

## Objectives Achieved
- Learn to create graphs with the Matplotlib library
